Player files:
- player_task1.cpp holds the basic working player,
    made for task 1 of assignment part 1
    
- player_task2.cpp holds a player with a rudimentary heuristic
    (maximize number of my stones on the board), made for task
    2 of assignment part 1.

- player.cpp holds the minimax player, currently set to use
    minimax depth 2, made for task 3 of assignment part 1.

To test player_task*.cpp, rename the file to player.cpp, then
make.

The player compiles to the executable mweidner.
